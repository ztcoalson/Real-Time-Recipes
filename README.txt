We will be making a web app that allows clients to input ingredients and the server
will output recipes. These recipes will contain the ingredients that the user entered
as well as a couple that have 1-2 ingredients missing. Additionally, the user can
use filters (diets, cuisines, meal type, cost, cook time, etc) which wil filter out
recipes. Finally, the user can enter their own recipes.
